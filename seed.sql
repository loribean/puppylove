He loves people despite what he’s been through, and we promise him we would find him a good family who will never abandon him again! Lucki is very active and fun-loving, but tends to nip when we are trying to leash him. He also does not like being towelled dry after showers, and can go into a nipping frenzy. He would do well with a firm adopter who’d be able to train him and expand his energy through lots of exercise and mental stimulation.','https://source.unsplash.com/egnAFVYS_h0/400x400','9 Years','Male',true);

He loves his walks and always does his signature tail wag when he sees the leash and knows it’s time. During walks, he can be occasionally skittish when joggers or vehicles run/drive past. He’s incredibly gentle and half the time lazy and would enjoy nothing more than just sleeping quietly besides his fosterer.','https://source.unsplash.com/2l0CWTpcChI/400x400','6 years','female',false);

She cowers away when we approach, but would allow us to stroke and carry her, and eat from our hands. She’s come a long way, and we do believe it’s time to find a patient family, who can provide her a more conducive and comfortable environment to blossom and open up even more!','https://source.unsplash.com/QRuWZe5xhLQ/400x400','2 years','male',true);
